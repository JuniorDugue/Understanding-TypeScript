# Understanding TypeScript

    by default `.values` are read as strings, so even if you tried to add numbers it'd always concatenate as a str and not an int

![](/img/example1.jpg)
![](/img/example2.jpg)
![](/img/example3.jpg)

---

- adding an if check is an alternative to prevent that error of adding strings 
  ![](/img/example4.jpg)
  ![](/img/example5.jpg)

---

## installing typescript
![](/img/example6.jpg)
